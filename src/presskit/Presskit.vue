          <h1>Sound Realms Press Kit</h1>

          <p>This page contains content to use when featuring Sound Realms in any type of media.</p>

          <h1>What is Sound Realms?</h1>

          <p>Sound Realms is a brand new project created by the Swedish games publisher Varghand Publishing AB. United by a passion for old school RPGs, we set out in 2020 to craft a new way of enjoying solo adventures. We have since developed a smartphone application for iOS and Android which enables you to play through captivating solo adventures. What makes Sound Realms stand out from other RPG apps on the market is the fact (as implied by the name Sound Realms) that all our games are audio-based. A professional voice-over actor acts as your Dungeon Master and takes you through dangerous dungeons and mysterious temples, backed by a cinematic musical score and top of the line sound effects. In time Sound Realms will be expanded to include not only fantasy, but also sci-fi, horror, and post-apocalyptic games.</p>
          <p>All this is presented in a design that makes you instantly remember your old solo adventure books, complete with beautiful original illustrations and artwork. Incorporated in the game is a modified version of an actual classic paper back RPG rule set, Chaosium Inc’s ”Basic Roleplaying System” (BRP), and all types of digital dice and a character sheet for you to see your inventory and your character’s progress.</p>

          <h1>What is Mace & Magic?</h1>
          <p>Mace & Magic is Sound Realms’ first series of RPG audio solo adventures. The genre is dark fantasy and is set in the “Forsaken Lands of Mihr”, a medieval, more or less traditional fantasy world that has been struck by “the Magiklysm”. The Magiklysm was an apocalyptic event caused by a war between two guilds of rival sorcerers that has completely transformed the world of Mihr into a treacherous and chaotic realm. The Magiklysm opened gates to other planes and invoked outerworldly beings and monsters, that compete with dragons and more traditional fantasy adversaries. The surviving races and nations of Mihr built a fortified city called Decagonia, and this is the center of the current civilisation. Surrounding it is only peril and the opportunity for adventure! With the Forsaken Lands of Mihr we aim to create a world where more or less anything can happen, where the emphasis lies on mysteries and the unique rather than orthodox fantasy encounters and events.</p>

          <h1>Basic Roleplaying System</h1>

          <p>Mace & Magic uses a modified version of Chaosium Inc’s classic rule set, Basic Roleplaying System. We chose this ruleset because of it’s adaptability and how we could start out with very basic rules and easily add on layers of more advanced rules as we go along. Basic Roleplaying System was also chosen for nostalgic reasons since it was the rule set featured in the classic Swedish paperback roleplaying game “Drakar & Demoner” (Dragons and Demons) that was the leading Swedish paperback RPG when we grew up.</p>

          <h1>The Format</h1>

          <p>We aim to take full advantage of the fact that Sound Realms: Mace & Magic is a digital product. For one thing, we can dynamically change the contents of the adventure from one playthtough to the next. For this purpose, tons of random tables for encounters, monster, items, weapons, side quests and so on will be created. We will also take the advantage of having a ”digital Dungeon Master”, which means we can use a detailed rules set without the player being bogged down by having to remember all the rules or perform cumbersome calculations.</p>
          <p>The goal is to create as many adventures for Mace & Magic as possible and as you play, your character will progress in a campaign type of manner. We also aim to create another type of game mode to be played between adventures when characters can buy and sell trinkets, train skills and visit taverns to possibly unlock new side quests etc. A game mode for travels between adventures and towns will also be incorporated in time. We aim to build a lot of this in the way that quickplay rules were written in old school RPGs, so the quick travel system will mainly be based on random events from rolls on specific tables.</p>

          <h1>The Mystery of the Silent Islands</h1>

          <p>The Mystery of the Silent Islands is the first full campaign that will be produced for Sound Realms – Mace & Magic. The campaign will be divided into six adventures (plus side quests) which in total is expected to have an average of seven hours playing time. Depending on what decisions you make and which path you chose the campaign will span between five and nine hours of playing time. In order to finance our ambitious plans for The Mystery of the Silent Islands (including voice-overs, music, and tons of detailed illustrations), a Kickstarter campaign will be launched in April 2022.</p>

          <h1>Why a digital game?</h1>
          <p>
            To digitalise solo RPG rules comes with many advantages. A digital
            application offers far less limitations than a book. We aim to
            create the adventures so they offer a different experience in as
            many ways possible every time played so they can be replayed several
            times. In time the app will also contain numerous side quests, vast
            lists of treasure and equipment and enormous bestiaries ready to be
            randomised into the adventures using any number of modifications.
            The team puts a lot of focus into exploring in what ways we can
            develop the app and the take advantage of the fact that it is a
            digital product. The suspense of the voice-overs is unparalleled as
            they can be carefully planned and designed, we also have the option
            of retakes until we achieve perfection. The sound effects and music
            are also introduced with the exact right timing to create the most
            captivating and dramatic experience possible.

          <h1>The story so far</h1>
          <p>
            The idea was formed in Oscar Carlquist's head a long, long time ago.
            Back in the mid-nineties Oscar played and cherished solo adventure
            books and solo RPG quests. Since he is a vocalist and worked in
            music studios and took the occasional voice-over assignments, he
            came to realise the great potential in making real audio productions
            of the adventure books and quests. Adding music and sound effects to
            a capturing voice-over performance he believed would really enhance
            the adventures that he had played over and over again since
            childhood. Back then the limitations were obvious since an adventure
            would span over more than several audio CDs and the rules and dice
            rolls etc would still have to be done separately with pen and paper.
            This idea however refused to leave Oscar’s head and quite soon came
            the introduction of MP3 files and the internet and the possibilities
            became slightly more favourable. The dream lived on and as smart
            phones revolutionised our lives Oscar began the quest of fulfilling
            his old dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013 Oscar acquired his own professional recording studio and
            began working as a sound engineer. One of the bands he came to
            produce in his studio happened to feature Gustav Sundin, a
            role-playing game obsessed software programmer who Oscar pitched his
            vision for. Gustav really liked the idea. Time passed, children were
            born, bands went on tours and career opportunities were seized but
            the idea lived in both Oscar's and Gustav's heads and in early 2020
            in the mist of a world crippling pandemic that killed live music
            Oscar and Gustav found the break they needed to really dive into the
            plan and process of bringing this vision to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so the time has come! Oscar's lifelong experience as vocal
            performer and his sound engineering skills combined with Gustav's
            programming expertise, and the creation of a team of illustrators
            and a composer have incarnated the vison and a demo adventure is
            ready for download!
