            When collecting personal information, we will state the purpose of collection and will

            <li>
              to manage or transfer our assets or liabilities, for example in the case of an

          </p>
          <p>
            When your personal information is to be used for a purpose not previously identified,
            the new purpose will be disclosed to you prior to such use, and your consent will be
            sought unless the use is authorized or required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may work with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as website
            hosting services, payment processing services and product delivery services. Those
            service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to
            deliver the service in question, and they will be required to maintain the
            confidentiality of that information.
          </p>
          <h3>Transfers of Information</h3>
          <p>
            Varghand Publishing AB is a company with operations around the world. By using the Varghand's services,
            you acknowledge and agree that your information may be processed outside your country of
            residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have
            different data protection frameworks than your region.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this
            policy for transfers of information outside the country of collection. For example, when
            we transfer personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside the
            European Economic Area, we rely on transfer mechanisms adopted by the European
            Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, like Standard Contractual Clauses. We
            may also need to transfer your information to provide the Sound Realms services to you in
            accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            We may use cookies to collect your personal information. Cookies are unique identifiers
            which are used to customize your website, mobile application or social media site
            experience. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change
            your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the
            chance to decide whether or not to accept the cookie. A cookie does not tell us who you
            are, your email address, or any other personal information. We use the information it
            provides to help us improve our website, mobile application, social media site and our
            services, and to provide our visitors with a better visit. Even without accepting a
            cookie you can still access many of the features on the site. There may, however, be
            limitations on your use of some site functions.
          </p>
          <h3>Consent</h3>
          <p>
            We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties, and we will obtain
            your consent to collect, use or disclose personal information except where we are
            authorized or required by law to do so without consent. For example, we may collect, use
            or disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent where:
          </p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>the information is publicly available, as defined by statute or regulation;</li>
            <li>we are obtaining legal advice; or</li>
            <li>
              we reasonably expect that obtaining consent would compromise an investigation or
              proceeding.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Other exceptions may apply.</p>
          <p>
            Your consent can be express, implied or given through an authorized representative such
            as a lawyer, agent or broker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consent may be provided orally, in writing, electronically, through inaction (such as
            when you fail to notify us that you do not wish your personal information
            collected/used/disclosed for various purposes after you have received notice of those
            purposes) or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal, contractual and other
            restrictions, provided that you give reasonable notice of withdrawal of consent to us.
            On receipt of notice of withdrawal of consent, we will inform you of the likely
            consequences of the withdrawal of consent, which may include our inability to provide
            certain services for which that information is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any material, information or other communication (including questions, comments and
            suggestions) you transmit to us through our website, social media sites or other online
            sites, or mobile applications will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.
            We may forward your communications and other personal information to any of our offices
            or affiliates throughout the world in connection with any products or services you
            request, or in connection with any communications you wish to have with us, and you
            consent to us doing so.
          </p>
          <h3>Limits on Collection</h3>
          <p>
            We will not collect information indiscriminately and will limit collection of
            information to that which is reasonable and necessary for the above purposes. We will
            also collect information as is otherwise authorized by law.
          </p>
          <h3>Limits on Using, Disclosing and Retaining Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            We will only use and disclose your personal information for the purposes set out above
            and as authorized by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will keep personal information used to make a decision affecting you for at least one
            year after using it to make the decision, unless otherwise permitted or required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will destroy, erase or make anonymous documents or other records containing personal
            information as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the original purpose is no longer
            being served by retention of the information and retention is no longer necessary for
            legal or business purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will take due care when destroying personal information so as to prevent unauthorized
            access to the information.
          </p>
          <h3>Accuracy</h3>
          <p>
            We will make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal information we are using or
            disclosing is accurate and complete. In some cases, we rely on you to ensure that
            certain information, such as your address or telephone number, is current, complete and
            accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you demonstrate the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information, we will
            amend the information as required. If appropriate, we will send the amended information
            to third parties to whom the information has been disclosed.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a challenge regarding the accuracy of personal information is not resolved to your
            satisfaction, we will annotate the personal information under its control with a note
            that the correction was requested but not made.
          </p>
          <h3>Safeguards</h3>
          <p>
            We protect the personal information in our custody or control by making reasonable
            security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure,
            copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will take reasonable steps, through contractual or other reasonable means, to ensure
            that a comparable level of personal information protection is implemented by the
            suppliers and agents who assist in providing services to you. However, confidentiality
            and security are not assured when information is transmitted electronically.
          </p>
          <h3>Providing Access</h3>
          <p>
            Upon written request and authentication of identity, we will provide you with your other
            personal information under our control, information about the ways in which that
            information is being used and a description of the individuals and organizations to whom
            that information has been disclosed. We will make the information available within 30
            days or provide written notice where additional time is required to fulfil the request.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some situations we may not be able to provide access to certain personal information.
            This may be the case where, for example, disclosure would reveal personal information
            about another individual, the personal information is protected by solicitor/client
            privilege, the information was collected for the purpose of an investigation or where
            disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that, if
            disclosed, could harm our competitive position. We may also be prevented by law from
            providing access to certain personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where an access request is refused, we will notify you in writing, document the reasons
            for refusal and outline further steps which are available to you.
          </p>
          <h3>Deletion</h3>
          <p>
            We provide you with the ability to cancel your Sound Realms account and delete your
            information by contacting us at the email below.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before processing your deletion
            request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny the request. Please note
            that we will retain and use information about you as necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like access requests, we will notify you in writing if we deny your request to delete
            your information.
          </p>
