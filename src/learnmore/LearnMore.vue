          <h1>The story so far</h1>
          <p>
            The idea was formed in Oscar Carlquist's head a long, long time ago.
            Back in the mid-nineties Oscar played and cherished solo adventure
            books and solo RPG quests. Since he is a vocalist and worked in
            music studios and took the occasional voice-over assignments, he
            came to realise the great potential in making real audio productions
            of the adventure books and quests. Adding music and sound effects to
            a capturing voice-over performance he believed would really enhance
            the adventures that he had played over and over again since
            childhood. Back then the limitations were obvious since an adventure
            would span over more than several audio CDs and the rules and dice
            rolls etc would still have to be done separately with pen and paper.
            This idea however refused to leave Oscar’s head and quite soon came
            the introduction of MP3 files and the internet and the possibilities
            became slightly more favourable. The dream lived on and as smart
            phones revolutionised our lives Oscar began the quest of fulfilling
            his old dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013 Oscar acquired his own professional recording studio and
            began working as a sound engineer. One of the bands he came to
            produce in his studio happened to feature Gustav Sundin, a
            role-playing game obsessed software programmer who Oscar pitched his
            vision for. Gustav really liked the idea. Time passed, children were
            born, bands went on tours and career opportunities were seized but
            the idea lived in both Oscar's and Gustav's heads and in early 2020
            in the mist of a world crippling pandemic that killed live music
            Oscar and Gustav found the break they needed to really dive into the
            plan and process of bringing this vision to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so the time has come! Oscar's lifelong experience as vocal
            performer and his sound engineering skills combined with Gustav's
            programming expertise, and the creation of a team of illustrators
            and a composer have incarnated the vison and a demo adventure is
            ready for download!
